    question: "How do I save in fees using INSDI3RS.io vs other ticketing platforms?",
    answer: "<p>Platforms such as Ticketmaster, StubHub, GET Protocol and Yellowheart take on average 3% at a minimum per transaction (CC) + add on fees that you can&#39;t control + gas fees per transaction, upsetting your fans and forcing them to spend more. With INSID3RS.io, you pay the package chosen + 1.5% fees. That&#39;s it.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I need more 1P data?",
    answer: "<p>Recent updates in privacy laws and software such as IOS 14 &amp; IOS 15 are making it much more difficult to monetize marketing efforts by ensuring targeted delivery. With our KYC verified, 1=1 technology, INSID3RS.io ensures direct targeting, attribution, and scaling with wallet-ID based persona building.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the INSID3RS.io Global Council?",
    answer: "<p>A global body consisting of executives in the event production, management, marketing &amp; technology realms. This council will ideate and vote on new product releases, how to use our community fund, and solution identification within the live event industry. The council is limited to the first 50 Lifetime tier Partners.</p>",

  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of using NFT ticketing?",
    answer: "<ol> <li>Generation of more marketable data - Verified wallet ID based profiles provides a deeper understanding of the live events your fans are engaging with in the marketplace. Since these wallets are linked to a device, all data is verifiable and instantly up to date. From these profiles, our partners understand what channels are driving revenue, what personas are purchasing and what interactions are occurring that provide insight into other culture or trend related events, expanding your audience into a more verifiable look-a-like.</li>&nbsp; <li>Eliminate fraud and price gouging - With verified, 1=1 technology, all tickets are digitized and verified via the wallet they are currently in. Scan at the gate to verify the wallet and you know they are the ticket owner. As the event creator, you have 100% control over all fees, including secondary market mark ups. This keeps bulk buyers and resellers from increasing the ticket value astronomically.</li> &nbsp;<li>Perpetual &amp; Net-new Revenue - Fan engagement = increased value and with NFT ticketing, you as the event creator can make perpetual revenue based on each rent or resell of your tickets issued. Plus, by adding additional perks into each tickets &quot;smart contract&quot;, you can entice new channels of revenue organically.</li> </ol>",
  },
  {
    question: "What is unlockable content?",
    answer: "<p>Unlockable content refers to content embedded within your assets that only become visible after an interaction such as attending an event, selling or gifting your NFT.</p>  <p>For example, once a ticket is redeemed your ticket may transform to include high res files, videos from the event, secret messages etc.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a crypto wallet?",
    answer: "<p>A crypto wallet is an application or hardware device that allows users to store and transfer digital assets like cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). You can choose to connect a crypto wallet, but all tickets will still show up under your User Profile.</p>  <p>How do they work? When you download a crypto wallet, you take control of two 42-character keys; a public key, known as your wallet address, and a private key. You can think of your public key as your shareable bank account info, so copy and paste it in when people ask for your address. Your private key works like a password and should remain private.</p> &nbsp; <p>Security: Keeping your funds safe</p> <p>Understanding risk is key to successfully navigating the brave new world of crypto and NFTs. If you forget your password to the INSID3RS.io, you can reset your password at insid3rs.io.</p>   <p>If you forget your password to your Metamask wallet, you can get access to your wallet via your &ldquo;seed phrase&rdquo;, a series of words that accompany all wallet addresses. It&rsquo;s good practice to write down and safely store your seed phrase in multiple places when you first download your wallet, so if you can&#39;t find it, search online for info or reach out to your wallet provider before buying NFTs or storing digital currencies.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods are accepted in the INSID3RS.io marketplace?",
    answer: "<p>We have built-in native fiat payment acceptance via the Stripe payment platform, enabling fans to buy with credit/debit card. We also enable fans to purchase in crypto, including BTC, ETH, MATIC, USDC and several other currencies.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "How do secondary sale royalties benefit our creators?",
    answer: "<p>Utilizing &ldquo;smart contracts&rdquo; in our NFT ticket sales, INSID3RS.IO enables event creators to receive royalty payments not only on the initial sale of a ticket but continuing royalties on each subsequent sale on the secondary market. This is also possible with concerts, sporting events, private popups, conferences, theme parks - basically anything with a ticket!</p>   <p>The smart contract lives on the NFT indefinitely. Each time an NFT ticket or other asset is sold on a secondary marketplace, event creators are routed their percentage.</p>   <p>More troubling is that secondary ticket sites and scalpers, utilizing bots, purchase large blocks of tickets for events when they are first released. This allows the scalpers and secondary sites to corner the ticket market to drive up prices and demand. The costs and fees can end up being four to five times the face value, which can price even diehard fans out of attendance.</p>   <p>Worse for the event creator is that zero percent of the revenue from those secondary sales goes back to benefit them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>With NFTs and smart contracts, INSID3RS.io can help fix this.</p>",

    question: "Dispute Resolution",
    answer: '<p>Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms of Service.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: INSID3RS.io LLC, 420 East 55th Street, California, NY 10022. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (&ldquo;ADR Provider&rdquo;) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms of Service. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (&ldquo;Arbitration Rules&rdquo;) governing the arbitration are available online at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1- 800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand</p> <p>U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney&rsquo;s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Time Limits. If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND</p> <p>HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY</p> <p>TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Small Claims Court Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party&rsquo;s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within California for such purpose.</p>',

    question: "Auction Terms",
    answer: '<p>The Company NFTs may be sold by Company as part of an auction. You will be permitted to submit bids for a Company NFT through the NFT Platform or such other means that Company designates in its sole discretion. You must pay for the purchase via the currency set forth by Company, which may be in dollars or cryptocurrency. Company may set minimum bid amounts for any Company NFT auction.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As soon as you place and confirm your bid amount, you agree that you may not, under any circumstances, amend, retract or revoke your bid. Company is not responsible for any errors made in your bidding. Company reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion to reject, revoke or refuse to accept any bid (even those that have been previously accepted); to withdraw any Company NFT from being eligible for purchase, whether during or after the sale, including for failing to meet any reserve prices; to restart or continue the bidding even if the bidding has finished; or in the case of error or dispute and whether during or after the sale, to continue the bidding, determine the successful bidder, cancel the sale of the lot, or re-offer and re-sell any lot. If any dispute relating to bidding arises during or after the sale, Company&rsquo;s decision in exercise of this option is absolute and final.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Bids may only be submitted between the dates and times specified for that Company NFT, or as otherwise permitted by Company in its sole discretion. However, Company may extend the bidding window to always ensure a buffer period (such as five minutes) exists between the last bid and closing time of that bidding window. These extensions may continue indefinitely until there is no more bidding activity on the Company NFT for such designated period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The purchase price of any auction will include the hammer price and the buyer&rsquo;s premium (in the case of a sale by auction) or a &ldquo;Buy Now&rdquo; price if that is offered by the Company, as well as any all shipping and related costs and charges, any applicable duties, goods, sales use, compensating or service tax or value added tax.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Company may provide a &ldquo;Buy Now&rdquo; feature that allows you to pay for a Company NFT at a specific price without bidding during an auction. If you purchase such a lot at the &ldquo;Buy Now&rdquo; price, these NFT Terms and auction terms will apply to the purchase or bid in the same manner as if you had been the successful bidder in an auction for that Company NFT.</p>',

If in our opinion, you do not satisfy our bidder identification and registration procedures, we may refuse to register you to bid or permit your participation in the sale and if you make a successful bid, we may cancel your bid and sell the Company NFT to another person.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Once Company has completed all bidder identification and registration procedures set forth above, Company will contact the buyer of a Company NFT to arrange for secure transmission of the purchased Company NFT via a cryptocurrency wallet or other mutually agreed upon means. Such buyer is solely responsible for any errors that may occur in such transfer due to providing us incorrect information about their wallet, its keys, or other relevant information required to facilitate such transfer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When you make purchases through the NFT Platform, including, without limitation, any purchase for Company NFTs, you must provide and maintain valid payment information (e.g., credit card number) in connection with your Account with us.
